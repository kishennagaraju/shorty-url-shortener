# Shorty Url Shortener

This is a sample Url Shortener project. Not for Production usage. This project was developed as a part of learning /
assignment. This project uses the following Tech Stack:

- React v18 ([https://react.dev/](https://react.dev/)).
- Typescript ([https://www.typescriptlang.org/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/))
- Supabase ([https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/))
- ShadCDN ([https://ui.shadcn.com/](https://ui.shadcn.com/))
- Recharts ([https://recharts.org/](https://recharts.org/))

## Follow These Steps for setup

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Clone the Project from git.
- Rename the ``env_local`` file to ``.env`` and substitute the <b><u>SITE_URL</u></b> (Your Site URL in browser), <b><u>
  SUPABASE_KEY</u></b> and
  <b><u>SUPABASE_URL</u></b> (You'll get these 2 from Supabase when you create a new Project.)
- Run ``npm install``
- Run ``npm run dev``
